# Matthew's Shell Scripts

These are a series of utility scripts for Bash and ZShell from Matthew McCullough. Many are derived from prior works of open source, but some original URLs have been lost. Please point out any original art URLs and they will be added. I always strive to give credit to prior art authors.

Please fork, fix, enhance, and send pull requests.
